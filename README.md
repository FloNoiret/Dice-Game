# Dice-Game

Creation of an online game according to client's demands (Functionalities, Rules and Pre-defined Design). 

The main goal was to be able to play with 2 people at a dice game with a current score at each round and a global score. The winner is decided by the first one reaching 100pts. 

In order to create the game, I used 3 languages : HTML, CSS and Javascript ECMAScript via DOM API.
